This is my work with the Scheme (LISP) interpreter outlined in chapter 4 of Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs (SICP). I'm also working through the exercises on my own, and seeing how far I can
get without looking up anything. If I don't fully code an exercise, it's because I'm short on time and
I don't see the exercise as the best use of time at the moment (but I'll still give a brief write up
of what needs to be done).

Of course, these are just my own answers and not checked against anything. I've tested most of them against
basic cases, and I try to maintain changes and make sure they still work while adding extra features.

Using the MIT Scheme evaluator on Arch. To run the evaluator with an input script, use
```
scheme --load evaluator.scm < test.scm
```

Completed exercises:
 - Chapter 4.1: 4.1 - 4.24
